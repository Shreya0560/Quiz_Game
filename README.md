# Quiz_Game 
In this project, I used a preset list of questions to ask users a True/False question. Users must type either "True" or "False" in order to answer the question. The program then prints whether the answer was correct or incorrect. This python project taught me how to create my own classes with functions as well as how to import those classes.
